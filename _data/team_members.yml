  description: Djordje is broadly interested in understanding how structure gives rise to function in biological systems. For example, how the genes in a genome combine to determine a trait (genotype-phenotype maps), or how the species within a community collectively contribute to a function (for example, degradation of a compound). I like to think in terms of general principles, which allow us to make predictions and come up with engineering strategies.

  description: Minke is interested in engineering the function of microbial communities. She combines different computational approaches, such as genome-scale metabolic modeling or fitness landscape analysis. She tackles both fundamental and applied questions. A major focus of her work is understanding and engineering electrosynthetic biofilm communities (CO2 + electricity to product).

  education1: B.Sc. Life Science, University of Belgrade, Serbia
  description: Uroš is interested in understanding how we can rationally steer microbial community composition using metabolic intervention. His work is based on quantitatively characterizing model communities assembled both in high-throughput and in bioreactor settings. In his project, he is using the UNLOCK facility.

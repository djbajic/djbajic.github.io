  description: I am broadly interested in understanding how structure gives rise to function in biological systems. For example, how the genes in a genome combine to determine a trait (genotype-phenotype maps), or how the species within a community collectively contribute to a function (for example, degradation of a compound). I like to think in terms of general principles, which allow us to make predictions and come up with engineering strategies.

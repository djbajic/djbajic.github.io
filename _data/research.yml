  description: Constraint-based metabolic modeling has emerged as one of the most effective tools for predicting metabolic 
               traits from genomes. This offers the unique possibility of exploring empirically calibrated fitness landscapes 
               on a large scale. Working as part of a large collaboration with the laboratories of
               Daniel Segre,
               Will Harcombe
               and Kiril Korolev,
               I have helped develop COMETS, a state of the art package for the "Computation of microbial ecosystems in time and space" [<a target="_blank" href="">Nature Protocols 2021</a>].
               I am currently using COMETS in several of the projects outlined below.

- title: "The evolution of metabolic strategies in microbes"
  description: Metabolic strategies, such as the decision to assimilate two substrates simultaneously versus
               sequentially (this latter known as diauxie) can play a key role in structuring microbial communities. In a
               collaboration with Sotaro Takano (AIST, Japan), we are currently trying to understand how does the structure of metabolic
               networks determine such strategies (see this Perspective in [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166919300722">Current Opinion in Biotechnology 2021</a>].

- title: "Macroevolutionary dynamics and innovation in microbial metabolism"
  description: Understanding the origin of metabolic diversity requires understanding how macroevolutionary
               processes, such as innovation and diversification, play out in the microbial world. We
               recently laid out several exciting future directions in this field in a Perspectives paper
               [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.718082/abstract">Frontiers in Microbiology 2021</a>].
               Currently, we are collaborating with Maria Rebolleda-Gomez 
               to explore the dynamics of microbial metabolic innovation using COMETS."


- title: "Ecological structure-function landscapes"
  description: Fitness landscapes (and more generally genotype-phenotype maps) are essentially an abstract device that 
               can be used to represent how the function of any system arises from the interaction between its components. 
               Applying this logic, I recently studied the “structure-function landscape’ of amylolytic microbial consortia
               composed of combinations of six Bacilli speces [<a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000550">PLoS Biology 2019</a>].
               Our approach allowed us to identify ecological interactions between species, which are analogous to epistatic 
               interactions on a fitness landscape. Furthermore, combining this approach with the theory of biochemical kinetics
               allowed us to mechanistically explain these interactions. 


               Subsequently, in collaboration with Felipe Lino and Morten Sommmer (DTU, Denmark), we also combined this framework with COMETS 
               to disentangle how complex ecological interactions affect biofuel production in sugar-cane fermenters 
               [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21844-7">Nature Communications 2021</a>].
               This helped us identify a new potential "industrial probiotic", which proved the usefulness of our theory in more 
               applied settings.   


               Currently, we are following up on these studies by investigating whether known properties of fitness landscapes 
               can translate to ecological structure function landscapes, helping us design robust synthetic consortia with 
               a specific function.

  fullnews: This work was a collaboration with PhD student Felipe Lino and Morten Sommer (DTU, Denmark). We found an useful application for the structure-function landscape theory that we developed <a target='_blank' href='https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000550'>previously</a>. We combined it with metabolic modeling (using COMETS) to characterize complex interactions between contaminants in industrial ethanol fermentation, and identify a potentially useful "industrial probiotic".

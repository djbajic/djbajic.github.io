**Genome-scale metabolic modeling of eco-evolutionary processes**. Constraint-based metabolic 
modeling has emerged as one of the most effective tools for predicting metabolic traits from genomes. This biological 
realism, together with the quick and easy computation of , offers the 
unique possibility of exploring empirically calibrated fitness landscapes on a large scale. 


Working as part of a large 
collaboration with the laboratories of [Daniel Segre](https://www.bu.edu/segrelab/), [Will Harcombe](http://www.wrharcombe.org/), 
and [Kiril Korolev](https://www.kirillkorolev.com/), I have helped develop COMETS, a state of the art package for the 
"Computation of microbial ecosystems in time and space" [\[Nature Protocols 2021\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00593-3). I am currently using COMETS in several 
of the projects outlined below.

**The evolution of metabolic strategies in microbes.** Metabolic strategies, such as the decision to assimilate two 
substrates simultaneously versus sequentially (this latter known as diauxie) can play a key role in structuring microbial 
communities. In a collaboration with Sotaro Takano (AIST, Japan), we are currently trying to understand how does the 
structure of metabolic networks determine such strategies and their evolvability (see this Perspective in [\[Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 2021\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166919300722).

**Macroevolutionary dynamics and innovation in microbial metabolism.** Understanding the origin of metabolic diversity 
requires understanding how macroevolutionary processes, such as innovation and diversification, play out in the microbial 
world. We recently laid out several exciting directions in this field in a Perspectives paper [\[Frontiers in Microbiology 2021\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.718082/abstract).
Currently, in collaboration with [Maria Rebolleda-Gómez](https://mrebolleda.github.io/) we are exploring the dynamics of 
microbial metabolic innovation and resource diversification using COMETS.

**Global epistasis and the predictability of evolution in microbial metabolism.** A key property observed across many empirical 
fitness landscapes is the presence of global epistasis, whose hallmark is the systematic scaling of mutation fitness effects 
with background fitness. However, which genes should be expected to exhibit strong or weak global epistasis, and why, remains 
poorly understood. We are currently using genome-scale metabolic models to study the mechanisms of global epistasis in metabolism, 
and combining it with COMETS to study how global epistasis affects the predictability of evolution.

**Ecological structure-function landscapes.** Fitness landscapes (and more generally genotype-phenotype maps) are essentially 
a theoretical device that can be used to represent how the function of any system arises from the interaction between its 
components. Applying this logic, I recently studied the “structure-function landscape’ of amylolytic microbial consortia
composed of combinations of six Bacilli speces [\[PLoS Biology 2019\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000550).
Our approach allowed us to identify ecological interactions between species, which are analogous to epistatic interactions 
on a fitness landscape. Furthermore, combining this approach with the theory of biochemical kinetics allowed us to 
mechanistically explain these interactions. 


Subsequently, in collaboration with Felipe Lino and [Morten Sommmer](https://www.biosustain.dtu.dk/research/research-groups/bacterial-synthetic-biology-morten-sommer), 
we also combined this framework with COMETS to disentangle how complex ecological interactions affect biofuel production in 
sugar-cane fermenters [\[Nature Communications 2021\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21844-7).
This helped us identify a new potential "industrial probiotic", which proved the usefulness of our theory in more 
applied settings.


Currently, we are following up on these studies by investigating whether known properties of fitness landscapes can translate 
to ecological structure function landscapes, helping us design robust synthetic consortia with a specific function.

I am currently a postdoctoral scientist at the Microbial Sciences Institute and the Department
of Ecology and Evolution at Yale University. I am broadly interested in understanding **how structure 
gives rise to function in biology**. For example, how the genes in a genome combine to determine a 
trait (genotype-phenotype maps), or how the species composition of a community result in, say, the 
consumption of a given nutrient.

Currently, my main focus is on understanding how the structure of microbial **metabolic networks** 
(the reactions encoded in a genome) shapes and constrains the evolution of metabolic traits such as growth 
rates or metabolic secretions. This question is fascinating from the evolutionary, but also the ecological 
standpoint, because metabolic traits govern microbial resource use and sharing, and are therefore 
critical for their ecological interactions.
 
To explore these questions, I combine **evolutionary theory**, **metabolic modeling** and 
microbiological **experiments**. This interdisciplinary approach is aimed at understanding both 
the physiological mechanisms linking metabolic genotypes to phenotypes, and the ecological 
and evolutionary forces ultimately shaping these mechanisms. If you want to know more about my 
work, check out my [current research projects](https://djbajic.github.io/research/) 
and some [finished pieces](https://djbajic.github.io/publications/).

I was born in Belgrade, then the capital of Yugoslavia and today of Serbia. As a child, I emigrated 
with my family to Madrid, Spain, where I grew up. In 2016, I moved to New Haven, 
Connecticut to join [Alvaro Sanchez's lab](http://sanchezlaboratory.com/) at Yale

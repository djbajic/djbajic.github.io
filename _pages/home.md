**Welcome!** 

We are a new group at the Section of [Industrial Microbiology](https://www.tudelft.nl/tnw/over-faculteit/afdelingen/biotechnology/research-sections/industrial-microbiology), within the Department of Biotechnology at TU Delft.

The word metabolism means *change*. Our group is interested in microbial metabolism in that broader sense: the change elicited by microbes on themselves, on each other, and on the environment. These processes of change are critical to understand microbial communities, but also to develop new strategies to engineer their composition and function.

In our work, we combine computer simulations, theory and laboratory experiments. We borrow concepts and approaches from different disciplines such as evolutionary biology, ecology, biochemistry or systems biology.

To learn more about our work, check out our [research page](https://djbajic.github.io/research/) and some [finished pieces](https://djbajic.github.io/publications/).

**Vacancies**

We currently have openings for **two fully funded PhD positions**. Interested students should send their applications to [PhD-IMB at tudelft.nl](mailto:PhD-IMB@tudelft.nl). Please explain why you are interested in pursuing a PhD, why our laboratory may be a good fit, and tell us a little bit about your background.
